## 3. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

### 🛠️ Technical Risks

#### 1. GitHub API Rate Limiting

- **Description:** Reaching the maximum allowed requests per hour, causing data fetching failures.
- **Mitigation:** \* Implement **Firestore Caching**: Store retrieved GitHub profiles for 24 hours to avoid redundant API calls.
  - **Selective Fetching**: Analyze only the top 10 most relevant repositories per user.
  - **OAuth Integration**: Use GitHub App tokens to increase the rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests per hour.

#### 2. AI Matching Accuracy

- **Description:** The AI might misinterpret developer skills or favor "code volume" over "code quality."
- **Mitigation:** \* **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Instructions to the LLM to prioritize logic complexity and language diversity.
  - **Human-in-the-loop**: Provide PMs with a "Confidence Score" and allow manual profile reviews before invitations.

#### 3. Integration Complexity

- **Description:** Managing the flow between Flutter, Firebase, GitHub API, and OpenAI.
- **Mitigation:** \* Using **Clean Architecture** in Flutter to decouple the UI from external API logic.
  - Comprehensive **Error Handling** to show user-friendly messages if one service fails.

---

### 🛡️ Security & Operational Risks

#### 4. Data Privacy & Security

- **Description:** Unauthorized access to user GitHub tokens or project data.
- **Mitigation:** \* Implement **Firebase Security Rules** for granular database access.
  - Never store GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in plain text; use secure session management.

#### 5. Financial Constraints (API Costs)

- **Description:** Scaling costs of OpenAI API usage during the testing/MVP phase.
- **Mitigation:** \* Set **Hard Usage Limits** in the OpenAI billing dashboard.
  - Optimize token usage by sending only the most relevant metadata to the AI.

---

### 📅 Project Management Risks

#### 6. Deadline Pressure

- **Description:** Balancing university requirements with project milestones.
- **Mitigation:** \* Strict **MVP Focus**: Prioritizing core matching features over secondary UI animations.
  - Weekly **Agile Sprint Reviews** to monitor progress and adjust tasks.

---

## 4. Monitoring & Review

The risk status will be reviewed during every sprint meeting.

- **Success Metric:** Zero critical API blocking during the demo phase.
- **Backup Plan:** In case of API failure, the app will serve cached data or a "Limited Mode" UI.
